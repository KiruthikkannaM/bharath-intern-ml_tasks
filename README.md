# Bharath-intern-Machine-learning-tasks
This is the repository in which i have posted my works for the tasks provided by the Bharath intern.
**Project Files**
task1:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for housing model analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing.csv: Dataset used in the housing model analysis.
task2:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movierecommendation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for movie recommendation system.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movies.csv: Dataset containing movie details used in the recommendation system.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: ratings.csv is not included in this repository due to its large size (over 675 MB). For the dataset, please refer to the Kaggle Movie Recommendation System dataset.
task3:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irisclassifier.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for Iris classification model.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iris.csv: Dataset used in the Iris classification analysis.
**Libraries and Dependencies**
To run the notebooks and reproduce the results, you will need to install the following libraries:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numpy: For numerical computations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matplotlib: For data visualization.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jupyter: For running Jupyter notebooks.
