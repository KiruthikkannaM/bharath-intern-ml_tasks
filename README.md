# Bharath-intern-Machine-learning-tasks
This is the repository in which i have posted my works for the tasks provided by the Bharath intern.<br>
**Project Files**<br>
task1:<br>
&nbsp;housing_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for housing model analysis.<br>
&nbsp;Housing.csv: Dataset used in the housing model analysis.<br>
task2:<br>
&nbsp;movierecommendation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for movie recommendation system.<br>
&nbsp;movies.csv: Dataset containing movie details used in the recommendation system.<br>
&nbsp;Note: ratings.csv is not included in this repository due to its large size (over 675 MB). For the dataset, please refer to the Kaggle Movie Recommendation System dataset.<br>
task3:<br>
&nbsp;irisclassifier.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for Iris classification model.<br>
&nbsp;iris.csv: Dataset used in the Iris classification analysis.<br>
**Libraries and Dependencies**<br>
To run the notebooks and reproduce the results, you will need to install the following libraries:<br>

&nbsp;pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
&nbsp;numpy: For numerical computations.<br>
&nbsp;matplotlib: For data visualization.<br>
&nbsp;scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.<br>
&nbsp;jupyter: For running Jupyter notebooks.<br>
